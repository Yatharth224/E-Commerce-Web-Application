## 🧠 Core Concepts Implemented

### 1. Django Fundamentals

* Models for database schema
* Views & URL routing
* Django Admin customization
* ORM queries & optimization

Example:

```python
class Product(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    stock = models.IntegerField()
```

---

### 2. Django REST Framework (DRF)

* Serializers for data transformation
* ViewSets & APIViews
* Pagination, filtering, searching

Example:

```python
class ProductViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Product.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ProductSerializer
```

---

### 3. Authentication & Security

* JWT Authentication
* Access & Refresh Tokens
* Role-based permissions

Flow:

```
User Login → Generate Access Token → Access Protected APIs
            → Refresh Token → Get New Access Token
```

---

### 4. Background Tasks (Celery)

Used for:

* Sending emails
* Order processing
* Notifications

Example:

```python
@shared_task
def send_order_email(order_id):
    # async email logic
    pass
```

---

### 5. Caching (Redis)

* Improves performance
* Reduces DB load

Example:

```python
@cache_page(60 * 5)
def product_list(request):
    return Response(data)
```

---

### 6. Testing Strategy

* Unit Testing (Django TestCase)
* API Testing (DRF APITestCase)
* Performance Testing

---

### 7. Logging & Monitoring

* Structured logging
* Error tracking
* Debug vs Production logs

---

## ⚙️ Database Design

### Entities:

* User
* Product
* Category
* Cart
* Order
* Payment

### Relationships:

* User → Orders (1:N)
* Order → Products (M:N)
* Product → Category (N:1)

---

## 🔄 API Design

### Sample Endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint         | Description   |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| GET    | /api/products/   | List products |
| POST   | /api/auth/login/ | User login    |
| POST   | /api/orders/     | Create order  |
| GET    | /api/cart/       | View cart     |

---

## 🔁 Application Flow (End-to-End)

### 1. User Authentication Flow

```
User → Login Request (username, password)
     → Django Auth + JWT
     → Access Token + Refresh Token Generated
     → Client Stores Token
     → User Accesses Protected APIs using Access Token
     → Token Expired → Use Refresh Token → New Access Token
```

---

### 2. Product Browsing Flow

```
User → Request Product List
     → DRF ViewSet
     → Check Cache (Redis)
         → If Cached → Return Response
         → Else → Fetch from DB → Store in Cache → Return
```

---

### 3. Add to Cart Flow

```
User → Add Product to Cart
     → API Validates Product & Stock
     → Cart Model Updated
     → Response Sent to Client
```

---

### 4. Order Placement Flow (Critical Flow)

```
User → Place Order
     → Validate Cart Items
     → Create Order in DB
     → Deduct Stock
     → Trigger Celery Task
         → Send Email / Notification
     → Return Order Confirmation
```

---

### 5. Background Task Flow (Celery)

```
Django App → Sends Task to Redis Broker
           → Celery Worker Picks Task
           → Executes (Email / Notification / Processing)
           → Updates Status (if required)
```

---

-----|---------|------------|
| GET | /api/products/ | List products |
| POST | /api/auth/login/ | User login |
| POST | /api/orders/ | Create order |
| GET | /api/cart/ | View cart |

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

* JWT-based authentication
* Password hashing
* Input validation
* Rate limiting
* Secure headers

---

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

### Stack:

* Gunicorn (WSGI server)
* Nginx (Reverse proxy)
* Docker (Containerization)
* Redis (Cache + Broker)

### Flow:

```
User → Nginx → Gunicorn → Django App → Database
                      → Redis → Celery Workers
```

---

## 📊 Performance Optimization

* Query optimization using select_related & prefetch_related
* Caching frequently accessed data
* Async processing using Celery
* Pagination for large datasets

---

## 📦 Future Enhancements

* AI-based recommendation system
* Real-time notifications (WebSockets)
* Payment gateway integration
* Microservices architecture

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

This project represents a **scalable, production-ready backend system** that follows industry best practices. It is designed to handle real-world e-commerce workloads with efficiency, security, and maintainability.
